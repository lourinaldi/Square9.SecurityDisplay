# Square9.SecurityDisplay

The Square9.SecurityDisplay Utility is an application that allows a user to view the Security Information for every user and archive in a database as well as export that information into a csv. The application runs as a Self Hosting Web-API/AngularJS which gives the user access to the interface via a web browser. 

To run Square9.SecurityDisplay simply compile Square9.SecurityDisplay. Edit the Web.config to have the correct path to the GlobalSearch API(ex: http://localhost/Square9Api) and run the Square9.SecurityDisplay.exe.
